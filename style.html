                    <p class="card-text">Ballet dance developed during the Italian Renaissance, before evolving in
                        France and Russia into a concert dance meant for public performance. This is in the form of a
                        ballet, in which the dance is choreographed with classical music.

                        Ballet productions vary between using elaborate costumes and staging and using minimal costuming
                        and bare staging.

                        Ballet is now a widespread, highly technical form of dance with many subgenres including
                        classic, romantic, neoclassical and contemporary.With six core recognised methods: the Cecchetti
                        method, the Bournoville method, the Vaganova method, the French School, the Royal Academy of
                        Dance method and the Balanchine method, ballet is studied professionally at top dance schools
                        all over the world.

                        Harlequin Floors have developed a range of specialist ballet dance floors providing enough
                        traction to prevent injury while still allowing for fluid movements demanded by ballet dancing.
                        Harlequin Cascade is one of our most popular ballet dance floors and can be laid over many of
                        our sprung floors.

                        Harlequin Floors also offer professional ballet barres available as either permanent wall
                        mounted, floor mounted or freestanding barres.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Jazz dancing has its roots in seventeenth-century African traditions, brought
                        to the Americas via the Atlantic slave trade as slaves continued dancing traditions in Brazil,
                        the US and elsewhere on the continents.

                        Known for its improvisational and dramatic body movements, the jazz dancing grew in popularity
                        in early twentieth-century jazz clubs.

                        Today, jazz dancing builds on African American vernacular dance styles that emerged along with
                        Jazz music in the US. Swing, the Lindy Hop, the Shimmy and the Charleston are popular kinds of
                        jazz dances.

                        For your Jazz dancers, our range of vinyl floors including Harlequin Studio and Harlequin
                        Allegro offer ideal surfaces for practice and performance.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Ballroom dance is a type of partner dance originating at the end of the
                        sixteenth century in France. Commonly used as shorthand for any partner dance, ballroom has
                        today evolved into two main subgenres – standard/smooth and Latin/rhythm.

                        Dances within these categories include the waltz, tango and foxtrot, and pasodoble, bolero and
                        samba.

                        Ballroom is a popular form of competitive dance, or dancesport, with competitions being held all
                        over the world.

                        With several sub-categories to ballroom dancing, dancers require a versatile floor. Harlequin
                        Fiesta and our specially crafted Harlequin Liberty Ballroom dance floor offer an excellent
                        versatile dance floor for all styles of ballroom dance.

                        Harlequin Liberty Ballroom is the used by the BBC’s ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ and Professional
                        World Ballroom Dance Champion, Christopher Hawkins.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Hip-hop dancing refers to a range of street dances that developed in relation
                        to hip hop music and culture. Hip-hop dancing dates back to the early 1970s in New York and
                        California, evolving out of Funk and the development of break beat.

                        Main styles of hip-hop dancing include Breaking, Locking and Popping, with derivative styles
                        emerging out of these including Memphis Jookin’, Turfing, Jerkin’ and Krumping. These were often
                        popularised and made mainstream after being featured in music videos of the time.

                        Today, hip-hop is performed in outdoor spaces, in dance studios and competitively.

                        Unlike many competitive dance styles, hip-hop is often improvisational with dance crews
                        challenging each other to dance battles.

                        At Harlequin Floors we have created Harlequin Freestyle, a specialist dance floor designed
                        specifically to meet the unique demands of Hip Hop and other street dance styles.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Tap dancing is a type of percussive dance characterised by the “tap” of shoes
                        hitting the floor as the person dances. Tap dancers often wear metal “taps” on the heel and toe
                        of a shoe to accentuate the sound.

                        Often performed as part of musical theatre, tap dancing often focuses on choreography and
                        formations, with more than one tap dancer performing at once.

                        Tap dancing characterises a range of dances including flamenco, rhythm, classical, broadway and
                        postmodern tap.

                        As a percussive dance style, tap dancers are looking to achieve a crisp, hollow sound to
                        accentuate their performance. This unique characteristic of tap dancing requires a specialist
                        floor for optimal performance. Harlequin Fiesta is an excellent choice of tap dance flooring for
                        your dance studio or performance space. Lay over a sprung flooring system such as Harlequin
                        Liberty to protect your dancer’s joints and allow them to perform with complete confidence.</p>

                        religions using various forms of folk dance to portray emotions, stories, historical events or
                        even aspects of daily life.

                        Some well known types of folk dance include: Bharatanatyam (India), Samba (Brazil), Flamenco
                        (Spain) and Hula (Hawaii). Some cultures may even perform multiple variations of folk dances,
                        with countries like South Korea performing individual dances for key events such as victories in
                        war, farming, music and religion.

                        Folk dances are commonly held at public events, where people can participate regardless of
                        whether they are professional or complete beginners. Such dances are also accompanied by
                        traditional music to further enhance the cultural experience.

                        Our range of portable performance floors and dance floor hire services are excellent for folk
                        dances held at all types of public venues and events.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Originating in Ireland, this form of traditional dance has been popular for
                        hundreds of years amongst Irish people and other countries worldwide. Popularised by shows such
                        as Riverdance, Irish dancing is famously known for its fabulous display of footwork and dance
                        formations.

                        Most Irish dancing events are traditionally accompanied by signing and music. During festivals,
                        dances are held to showcase talent and to compete for trophies or medals.

                        Whilst most people may recognise Irish dancing as being a group performance, there are many
                        well-known forms of solo Irish dances, such as the stepdance.

                        For Irish dance floors for your studio or performance space, consider our range of specialist
                        sprung dance floors. Couple with a Harlequin vinyl floor such as Harlequin Standfast to create
                        an excellent quality floor for your Irish dancers.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Considered as being a broad genre of dance, modern dance primarily arose from
                        western countries such as the USA and Germany during the late 1900s. While most forms of dance
                        are structured and feature set steps, the purpose of modern dance is to rely on the dancer’s
                        interpretation of the music and feeling to guide movements.

                        Modern dance was initially born out of dislike for the limitations of traditional dances such as
                        ballet, which often oppressed dancers with rigid rules and techniques.

                        Currently, modern dance is enjoyed across the world with participants having the ability to
                        practice ballet dancing without having to place strict focus on their techniques or turnout.
                        Instead, dancers can choose a piece of music and use unconventional movements to convey emotions
                        or to tell a meaningful story.

                        Inject even more creativity into your performance with Harlequin’s printed vinyl performance
                        floors. Print bespoke designs inspired by your choreography or choose from one of our standard
                        patterns.

                        Due to the multidisciplinary nature and freedom of modern dance, dancers will also feel at home
                        on many of Harlequin’s vinyl dance floors.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Swing is a variation of jazz dance which developed between the 1920s to the
                        1940s as a response to the growing popularity of swing jazz in America. With the evolution of
                        music that occurred during the Jazz era, dance also began to change with the likes of swing
                        music encouraging faster, more rigorous movements.

                        Popular forms of swing dance include the Lindy Charleston, the Jitterbug, Lindy Hop and the
                        Balboa, many of which are still performed today. Swing dancing would commonly be accompanied by
                        Big Band musicians who often played upbeat melodies which were smooth and easy to listen.

                        Swing dancers will feel at home on our range of vinyl dance floors. Similar to Jazz, Swing
                        dancers can create beautiful performances on Harlequin’s range of vinyl floors such as Harlequin
                        Reversible Pro with a high performance slip-resistant surface to protect your dancers.</p>
