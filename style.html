        Ballet dance developed during the Italian Renaissance, before evolving in France and Russia into a concert dance
        meant for public performance. This is in the form of a ballet, in which the dance is choreographed with
        classical music.

        Ballet productions vary between using elaborate costumes and staging and using minimal costuming and bare
        staging.

        Ballet is now a widespread, highly technical form of dance with many subgenres including classic, romantic,
        neoclassical and contemporary.

        With six core recognised methods: the Cecchetti method, the Bournoville method, the Vaganova method, the French
        School, the Royal Academy of Dance method and the Balanchine method, ballet is studied professionally at top
        dance schools all over the world.
